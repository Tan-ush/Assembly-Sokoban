# Assembly-Sokoban
The Sokoban game in RISC-V assembly, designed for Ripes, includes enhancements such as multiplayer mode, a leaderboard system, and pseudo-random level generation. Players move boxes onto target locations using intuitive keyboard controls, with real-time updates to the game state. Multiplayer mode enables cooperative or competitive play, while the leaderboard tracks the best completion times. Game logic efficiently handles collisions, movement constraints, and win conditions using a structured memory layout. Randomized level generation ensures replayability, making each session unique. Optimized assembly routines maintain smooth gameplay while adhering to RISC-V constraints.
